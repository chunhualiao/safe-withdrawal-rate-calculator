This application is deployed to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/liaoch/Safe-Withdrawal-Rate-Calculator).

This Hugging Face Space hosts an interactive application that performs Monte Carlo simulations to determine a safe withdrawal rate from a retirement portfolio. Users can adjust various financial parameters and instantly see the impact on portfolio success rates and projected portfolio paths.

## How to Use

1.  **Adjust Parameters**: On the left side of the interface, you will find several sections with sliders and number inputs:
    *   **Investment Details**: Set your initial investment, the number of years for the simulation, your target success rate, and the number of Monte Carlo simulations to run.
    *   **Market Assumptions**: Define the expected mean returns and standard deviations for stocks and bonds, their correlation, and your portfolio's stock allocation.
    *   **Inflation Assumptions**: Input the mean inflation rate and its standard deviation.
    *   **SWR Test Range**: Specify the range and step for the Safe Withdrawal Rates you want to test.
2.  **Run Simulation**: Click the "Run Simulation" button.
3.  **View Results**: The right side of the interface will display:
    *   **Calculated Safe Withdrawal Rate**: Text output showing the highest SWR that meets your target success rate and the corresponding initial annual withdrawal amount.
    *   **SWR Success Rates Plot**: A graph showing the probability of portfolio success for various withdrawal rates.
    *   **Sample Portfolio Paths Plot**: A visualization of how a sample of portfolios might perform over the simulation period.

## Technical Details

This application is built using:

*   **Python**: For the core simulation logic.
*   **NumPy**: For numerical operations and statistical calculations.
*   **Matplotlib**: For generating the simulation plots.
*   **Gradio**: For creating the interactive web interface, allowing easy deployment to Hugging Face Spaces.

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. The `app.py` file contains the Gradio application, and `requirements.txt` lists all necessary Python dependencies.
